**✨ Develop in the cloud:** Want to contribute or customize this integration? Open it directly in GitHub Codespaces - no local setup required!

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/nogic1008/ha_aircloudhome?quickstart=1)

## ✨ Features

- **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration through the UI - no YAML required
- **Full AC Control**: Power on/off, operating mode, target temperature, fan speed, swing direction
- **Polled Status**: Current room temperature and device state, updated at a configurable interval (default: 5 minutes)
- **Reconfigurable**: Change credentials anytime without removing the integration
- **Options Flow**: Adjust settings like update interval after setup
- **Multiple Units**: Supports multiple AC units across multiple family groups
- **Japan and Europe / Global Accounts**: Works with both the Shirokuma-kun (Japan) and airCloud Go (Europe / global) clouds

> **🛠️ Tested hardware:** Hitachi RAS-X40L2 (Japan); Hitachi RAK-VJ35RHAE indoor unit with RAM-G55N2HAE outdoor unit (Europe / global). Other **room air conditioners (RAC)** connected via AirCloud Home should work. Packaged air conditioners (PAC) use a separate API and are not supported.

**This integration will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`climate` | Air conditioning control (power, mode, temperature, fan speed, swing)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Integration

**Prerequisites:** Home Assistant 2026.11 or newer has the Marketplace built in (**Settings** → **Marketplace**). On older versions, install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store) first.

Click the button below to open the integration directly in HACS:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository in the Marketplace.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=nogic1008&repository=ha_aircloudhome&category=integration)

Then:

1. Click "Download" to install the integration
2. With HACS (before Home Assistant 2026.11), **restart Home Assistant**. The Marketplace loads it right away.

> [!NOTE]
> The My Home Assistant redirect will first take you to a landing page. Click the button there to open your Home Assistant instance.

<summary>**Manual Installation (Advanced)**</summary>

If you prefer not to use the Marketplace or HACS:

1. Download the `custom_components/aircloudhome/` folder from this repository
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant's `custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

</details>

### Step 1.5: Initial Setup with the Mobile App

**Important:** Before configuring this integration in Home Assistant, you must complete initial setup using the official Hitachi app for your region:

- **Japan:** **[Shirokuma-kun App (白くまくんアプリ)](https://kadenfan.hitachi.co.jp/ra/app2/)**
- **Europe and other countries:** **[airCloud Go app](https://aircloudhome.hitachiaircon.com)** (formerly airCloud Home)

1. **Download and install** the app on your smartphone (iOS/Android)
2. **Create an account** - Sign up for an AirCloud Home account using your email
3. **Register your AC unit** - Add your air conditioner to your account in the app

Without completing these steps, the Home Assistant integration will not be able to connect to your devices.

### Step 2: Add and Configure the Integration

**Important:** You must have installed the integration first (see Step 1), and restarted Home Assistant if Step 1 asked you to.

#### Option 1: One-Click Setup (Quick)

Click the button below to open the configuration dialog:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=aircloudhome)

Follow the setup wizard:

1. Select your region: **Japan** (Shirokuma-kun app) or **Europe / global** (airCloud Go app)
2. Enter your email address
3. Enter your password
4. Click Submit

That's it! The integration will start loading your data.

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **"+ Add Integration"**
3. Search for "Shirokuma AC (aircloudhome) Integration"
4. Follow the same setup steps as Option 1

### Step 3: Adjust Settings (Optional)

After setup, you can adjust options:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find **Shirokuma AC (aircloudhome) Integration**
3. Click **Configure** to adjust:
   - Update interval (how often to refresh data)
   - Enable debug logging

You can also **Reconfigure** your credentials and region anytime without removing the integration.

### Step 4: Start Using!

The integration creates climate entities for each of your AC units:

- **Climate**: Full AC control — power, mode (heat/cool/dry/fan/auto), target temperature, fan speed, swing direction
- Current room temperature is shown as the current temperature on each climate entity

Find all entities in **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Shirokuma AC (aircloudhome) Integration** → click on the device.

## Available Entities

### Climate

One climate entity is created per AC unit:

- **HVAC Modes**: Heat, Cool, Dry, Fan Only, Auto, Off
- **Temperature**: Set target temperature (16–32°C, 0.5°C increments)
- **Fan Speed**: auto, level_1, level_2, level_3, level_4, level_5
- **Swing Mode**: off, vertical, horizontal, both, on (auto)
- **Current Temperature**: Room temperature reported by the unit

## Configuration Options

### During Setup

Name | Required | Description
-- | -- | --
Email | Yes | Your AirCloud Home account email address
Password | Yes | Your account password

### After Setup (Options)

You can change these anytime by clicking **Configure**:

Name | Default | Description
-- | -- | --
Update Interval | 5 minutes | How often to poll the AirCloud Home cloud API (1–1440 minutes)
Enable Debugging | Off | Enable extra debug logging

> **Note:** State updates are not real-time. The integration polls the cloud API at the configured interval. For most use cases the default 5-minute interval is sufficient. Setting a shorter interval increases API requests; setting a longer interval reduces responsiveness.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

#### Reauthentication

If your credentials expire or change, Home Assistant will automatically prompt you to reauthenticate:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Look for **"Action Required"** or **"Configuration Required"** message on the integration
3. Click **"Reconfigure"** or follow the prompt
4. Enter your updated email and password, and check the **Region**: an account used with the wrong region also fails with an authentication error
5. Click Submit

The integration will automatically resume normal operation with the new credentials.

#### Manual Credential Update

You can also update credentials at any time without waiting for an error:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find **Shirokuma AC (aircloudhome) Integration**
3. Click the **3 dots menu** → **Reconfigure**
4. Enter new email/password
5. Click Submit

### Enable Debug Logging

To enable debug logging for this integration, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.aircloudhome: debug
```

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors

If you receive authentication errors:

1. Verify your email and password are correct
2. Check that your account has the necessary permissions
3. Wait for the automatic reauthentication prompt, or manually reconfigure

#### Device Not Responding

If your AC unit shows as unavailable:

1. Check your internet connection (this integration uses the AirCloud Home cloud API)
2. Verify the AC unit is powered on and connected
3. Try reloading the integration

>
> - Generate boilerplate code following Home Assistant patterns
> - Implement standard integration features (config flow, coordinator, entities)
> - Ensure code quality and type safety
> - Write documentation and comments
>
> Please be aware that AI-assisted development may result in unexpected behavior or edge cases that haven't been thoroughly tested. If you encounter any issues, please [open an issue](../../issues) on GitHub.
